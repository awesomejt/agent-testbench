# Project TODO

Task list for Agent Testbench, organized by ownership and project phase.
Last updated: 2026-05-25

## Needs Attention

Items here require Jason's input before agent work can continue.

- [ ] **pass_fail / score population** — Who or what determines whether a run passes or fails, and assigns a score? Options: human review via UI, automated assertion in the scenario file, or a post-run grader script. Needs a decision before the harness → CLI path is complete.
- [ ] **AI provider credentials** — Confirm API keys for target providers (Anthropic, OpenAI, local) are available in the test VM environment and how they should be injected (env vars, secrets manager, `.env` file on the VM).
- [ ] **Prod deployment** — When to promote to prod, and which VM / compose stack receives the prod images.

## Manual Validation

- [ ] Confirm Docker Compose + Traefik TLS works on local dev machine (requires `/etc/hosts` entries for `testbench.local` and `api.testbench.local`)
- [ ] Validate `docker compose --profile test run --rm tests` integration test flow against a live stack
- [ ] Confirm `deploy-prod` target and prod VM are ready before promoting

## AI Agent Work

### Implementation

- [ ] **Harness → CLI invocation** — After `run_agent_scenario` / `run_model_scenario` completes, serialize the `RunResult` and pipe it to `testbench record --data -` so results reach the API and DB. This is the last unconnected link in the data pipeline.
- [ ] **Web: runs list view** — Replace the Vite default scaffold in `web/src/App.tsx` with a paginated table of runs fetched from `GET /runs/`. Columns: run name, scenario, model, provider, total time, tokens/sec, pass/fail, cost, date.
- [ ] **Web: run detail view** — Clicking a row shows full run details including all token counts, error message if any, and raw event log.
- [ ] **Web: filter controls** — Wire the `scenario`, `model`, `provider`, `from`, `to` query params from `GET /runs/` into the UI as filter inputs above the runs table.
- [ ] **Harness batch runner** — A top-level entry point (CLI command or script) that iterates over all scenarios in `scenarios/` and runs each against a specified model, collecting results via the harness and recording each via the CLI.
- [ ] **Local cost calculation** — Implement the `(watts × seconds / 3600) × rate_per_kwh` formula in the harness for `type: model` local runs. Rate defaults to `$0.14`; make it configurable via env var or flag.
- [ ] **Fix `.coverage` files in git** — `api/.coverage` and `harness/.coverage` were accidentally committed. Remove from tracking (`git rm --cached`) and add to `.gitignore`.

### Tests And Quality

- [ ] **Integration test: CLI → API → DB** — Add an integration test (in `tests/integration/`) that posts a full run payload via the CLI binary and verifies it appears in `GET /runs/`.
- [ ] **End-to-end smoke test** — Manual or scripted path: load a scenario → run harness → CLI records result → verify row in DB → verify it appears in the web UI.
- [ ] **Web tests** — Add Vitest tests for the runs list and detail components once they exist.
- [ ] **Lint and type-check pass** — Run `make lint` and confirm all modules clean; confirm `tsc -b` passes in `web/`.

### Documentation And Deployment

- [ ] **README.md** — Add setup and usage instructions: prerequisites, `.env` setup, `docker compose up`, how to run a scenario, how to deploy.
- [ ] **Environment variable reference** — Document all env vars (DB, API keys, Harbor, VITE_API_URL) either in `README.md` or a dedicated `docs/Environment.md`.
- [ ] **Deployment runbook** — Document the full deploy workflow: `make deploy-dev`, validate on dev, promote to stage, then prod. Note the `/etc/hosts` or DNS entries required per environment.
- [ ] **QUALITY_CHECKLIST.md review** — Walk through the checklist before tagging a first release.
